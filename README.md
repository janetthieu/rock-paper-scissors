Can't decide if you should go to the gym? Play Rock Paper Scissors against a computer. Best out of 5, wins. You win - you go to the gym! You lose - you should still go to the gym, but we'll give you a free pass since you lost to a computer. [Play on desktop or mobile](https://janetthieu.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/).

## The Making of Rock, Paper, Scissors
Rock, paper, scissors initially began as a console only game. Next, I implemented a UI version. I developed it for desktop utilizing event listeners for click events. Eventually, I decided to make it mobile friendly. 

## Most Memorable Challenge
As I started planning out how I would add in event listeners for touch events, I felt smelly code approaching. Having separate event listeners for click events and touch events felt unnecessary. 

## Solution
After a quick search, this is when I learned about pointer events! Pointer events are all encompassing. This allowed for easier maintainability and readability. I was absolutely ecstatic! How perfect and efficient! This was definitely my favorite learning experience of this project.!
